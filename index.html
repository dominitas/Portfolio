    <p>I’ve created a few projects that I’m really proud of and that reflect my skills and interests. One of them is an FAQ page, where I focused on presenting information clearly and making it easy for users to find answers. Another project close to my heart is the 'Duke of Lithuania,' which I built to celebrate my Lithuanian heritage. It was a great opportunity to mix creativity with my passion for my culture.

      I also worked on a replica of the TOPO Centras website. It was a fun challenge to recreate its design and functionality, and it really helped me improve my HTML and CSS skills. Each of these projects taught me something new, whether it was about design, coding, or simply bringing an idea to life. They’re all part of my journey as a developer, and I’m excited to keep building and learning.</p>
